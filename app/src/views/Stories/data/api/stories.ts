Sign Up Log In Purchase a Subscription Shumaker Advisors announced Tuesday that Sanford would be joining the firm as an executive vice president and principal. The government relations arm of a law firm founded in 1925, Shumaker Advisors operates seven offices in Ohio, Florida, Michigan and the Carolinas, according to its website. “Mark's knowledge of policymaking at both the state and federal level is unmatched. He has a command of the issues, the process, and the politics, and our clients will be well served by his leadership,” said Shumaker Advisors Florida executive vice president David Jolly, a former congressman whose time in the House overlapped with Sanford's second congressional career. It wasn't immediately clear if Sanford, technically an advisor at the firm, would register as a lobbyist. “I have been honored to serve the citizens of South Carolina and of the United States and look forward to this new chapter,\" Sanford said. “I've always tried not only to make government smaller, but to well understand its details, and in this light I look forward to joining the team of outstanding professionals at Shumaker.” Sanford, 60, has been working to find a foothold since end of the most recent iteration of his political career. Winning three terms in the U.S. House in the 1990s, Sanford then was elected twice as governor before an extramarital affair marred the end of his second term. But Sanford's secret 2009 rendezvous to Argentina to visit his mistress while his in-the-dark gubernatorial staff told reporters he was hiking the Appalachian Trail, however, did not end his ability to win elections. After a brief hiatus and a divorce, he returned to politics, winning a special election to his old U.S. House seat in 2013 and holding on twice more before his criticism of Donald Trump Trump led to a 2018 primary loss. The next year, Sanford mounted a short-lived challenge to Trump himself, centering what he characterized as a “long shot” effort around warnings about the national debt. Some, including Sanford's former gubernatorial staffers, initially questioned whether the effort was a serious one, positing that it might be an effort to stay relevant after the 2018 defeat. Sanford's home state would ultimately opt not to hold a 2020 GOP presidential primary , clearing the way for Trump's nomination in South Carolina. Sanford ultimately dropped his presidential pursuit on the eve of televised hearings in the U.S. House for Trump's first impeachment trial, saying the issue had made it difficult for his campaign to gain traction. “You've got to be a realist,” Sanford said in November 2019 outside the New Hampshire statehouse. “What I did not anticipate is an impeachment.” In his new role with Shumaker, Sanford will be based in Charleston, according to information obtained by The Associated Press. “I think it's a great platform to apply the 25 years of ‘school of hard knocks' in the world of politics, and I look forward to it,” Sanford said. ——— Meg Kinnard can be reached at http://twitter.com/MegKinnardAP Copyright 2021 The Associated Press.

      "body": "Despite the public health awareness–raising effect of the pandemic, anti-vaccine and vaccine-hesitant sentiments still run rampant in the United States. A recent PBS NewsHour/NPR/Marist poll found that 30 percent of those surveyed in March 2021 told pollsters that, if offered the COVID-19 vaccine, they would not take it.\n\nThe huge number of vaccine-hesitant Americans might give the impression that anti-vaccination propaganda is rampant. Yet it turns out that a select few very loud voices are responsible for a great deal of online misinformation regarding vaccines. Their disproportionate ability to spread disinformation should give social media platforms pause.\n\nIndeed, according to the nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), a mere dozen individuals and their organizations are responsible for up to 65% of the anti-vaccine misinformation that is spreading on social media platforms.\n\nIn their recent report, the CCDH revealed that these twelve people and their groups have disseminated nearly two-thirds of the anti-vaccine misinformation they have been tracing on Facebook and Twitter between Feb. 1 and March 16 of this year. Overall the CCDH found that the information they had been tracing was shared or posted on one of those platforms roughly 812,000 times, even though their inaccurate statements about vaccines violate those companies' terms of service. The most famous of the so-called \"Disinformation Dozen\" is Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., nephew of President John F. Kennedy. The CCDH also found a number of prominent anti-vaccine advocates and proponents of alternative medicine.\n\nOne of them, Rizza Islam, has argued that Bill Gates is behind the COVID-19 pandemic, claimed he \"beat\" the disease through a special diet, and repeated the debunked claim that vaccines cause autism. (Although his Facebook account has been removed, he remains active on Twitter and the Facebook-owned Instagram.) Anti-vaccine entrepreneurs Ty and Charlene Bollinger have used their Facebook, Twitter and Instagram accounts (all of which remain active) to denounce the \"fake pandemic\" and spread an inaccurate story claiming that a COVID-19 vaccine had killed seven children in Senegal. They have also established ties with the far right, repeating the disproved talking point that Joe Biden stole the 2020 election from Donald Trump. Another anti-vaccine entrepreneur, Joseph Mercola, has referred to the pandemic as a \"scam\" and argued that \"hydrogen peroxide treatment\" can successfully treat most viral respiratory illnesses, including the coronavirus.\n\nWant more science stories in your inbox? Subscribe to Salon's weekly newsletter The Vulgar Scientist.\n\n\"The Disinformation Dozen — including Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Joseph Mercola, and Ty and Charlene Bollinger, among others — continually violate the terms of service agreements on Facebook and Twitter,\" the CCDH explains in the summary of their report. \"While some anti-vaxxers identified by CCDH have been removed from a single platform, comprehensive action has yet to be taken, and most remain active on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.\"\n\nIn addition to political and cultural motives, anti-vaxxers are often driven by a mistrust of statistics and experts who they do not personally know, especially if they come from institutions that they have been trained to distrust. Instead they are more inclined to believe the opinions of people they personally know and stories that they have heard, regardless of whether those sources are reliable, according to a recent book by Jonathan Berman, a professor at the New York Institute of Technology's College of Osteopathic Medicine.",

      "body": "Pro-Trump pundit, conservative media tycoon and self-proclaimed Parler investor Dan Bongino was apparently tricked into being promised shares of Parler by investor and conservative mega-donor Rebekah Mercer, according to former Parler CEO John Matze. This allegation is within a new lawsuit claiming that Bongino and Mercer used bullying and intimidation to take away Matze's shares in Parler when they ousted him.\n\nThe nearly 20-page lawsuit from Matze, filed in the Eighth Judicial District Court of Nevada, says that Bongino \"purports\" to be a shareholder in Parler, before elaborating that the former CEO believes that \"Mercer avoided executing any of the ownership documents to allow her to later dispute that Bongino has any such interest.\" \n\nBongino and a Parler spokesperson didn't respond to multiple Salon requests for comment as to whether Bongino actually owns shares in Parler. Bongino, a Fox News contributor and frequent guest on Sean Hannity's show, has for many months billed himself on the network as an investor in Parler, or as he put it on Jan. 18, \"an investor in both Parler and Rumble, alternative platforms.\" Matze appears to suggest that shares on the company may have never been signed over to Bongino at all.\n\nAs for how Bongino got involved in the company, Matze's suit claims that Parler investor Jeffrey Wernick wanted to bring the Trump-friendly pundit more into the fold while leveraging Bongino's clout in right-wing media to help bolster support for the site. According to the legal document, Wernick argued that \"Bongino could use his media presence and various media platforms and appearances in order to promote Parler, and that it was worth providing Bongino a stake in Parler for all of the promotion that Bongino would be able to accomplish.\"\n\nEarly in the lawsuit, Matze's lawyers write that \"Defendant Dan Bongino ... holds himself out as an owner in Parler. As set forth, Bongino was a party to, and an active participant in, the conspiracy to oust Matze from Parler, to defame him, and to steal his property.\"\n\nFollowing the Jan. 6 Capitol attack, Parler was booted from Amazon Web Services and the Apple App Store, which later left the site offline, over perceptions that the company had taken no action to remove extreme content from its platform, allowing insurrectionists to organize ahead of the Capitol siege. Salon has discovered that on Feb. 24, Bongino silently attempted to withdraw himself from the \"day-to-day\" operations at the by-then-controversial social media site. \n\n\"I am still an investor in Parler and remain such for as long as I want my money and assets tied up in there,\" Bongino said on his podcast that day. \"I still think that it is a great alternative to the tech tyrants at Twitter, Facebook and elsewhere. Having said that, as of today, I believe, am no longer with the day-to-day. I'm sorry. It's nothing personal; it's just, I just can't, folks. I've got a lot going on in my life. It's really that simple. I've got too many things to do.\" At around that time, Bongino was nearing the end of his treatment for Hodgkin's lymphoma and was about to step into the three-hour time slot on conservative talk radio previously occupied by the late Rush Limbaugh.",

          "The nearly 20-page lawsuit from Matze, filed in the Eighth Judicial District Court of Nevada, says that Bongino \"purports\" to be a shareholder in Parler, before elaborating that the former CEO believes that \"Mercer avoided executing any of the ownership documents to allow her to later dispute that Bongino has any such interest.\"",
          "Bongino, a Fox News contributor and frequent guest on Sean Hannity's show, has for many months billed himself on the network as an investor in Parler, or as he put it on Jan. 18, \"an investor in both Parler and Rumble, alternative platforms.\"",
          "As for how Bongino got involved in the company, Matze's suit claims that Parler investor Jeffrey Wernick wanted to bring the Trump-friendly pundit more into the fold while leveraging Bongino's clout in right-wing media to help bolster support for the site."

Like Trump, Lindell continues to promote the baseless conspiracy theory that President Joe Biden and the Democrats \"stole\" or \"rigged\" the 2020 election. Despite dozens of election lawsuits filed by Trump and his supporters in state and federal court, no evidence of widespread fraud has been brought forward to corroborate this extraordinary claim. But in Friday comments on the War Room: Pandemic podcast, which is hosted by former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, Lindell claimed he has been collecting evidence that will soon be brought before the Supreme Court.How bad a president was Donald Trump?Donald Trump's presidency is now behind us.

          "Like Trump, Lindell continues to promote the baseless conspiracy theory that President Joe Biden and the Democrats \"stole\" or \"rigged\" the 2020 election.",
          "Despite dozens of election lawsuits filed by Trump and his supporters in state and federal court, no evidence of widespread fraud has been brought forward to corroborate this extraordinary claim.",
          "But in Friday comments on the War Room: Pandemic podcast, which is hosted by former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, Lindell claimed he has been collecting evidence that will soon be brought before the Supreme Court.How bad a president was Donald Trump?Donald Trump's presidency is now behind us.",
          "But the debate over how bad a president he was has only just begun."

      "body": "Image used for representational purpose onlyImage used for representational purpose onlyThe total qualifiers in GATE 2021 dipped to 17.8% as compared to last year’s 18.8% despite flexibility in norms. To begin with, a ll test papers of GATE 2021 were entirely objective type including a few Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ), Multiple Select Questions (MSQ), and/or Numerical Answer Type (NAT) questions. While one or two subject papers were allowed, the two paper combinations could be chosen from the given list of combinations.In a first, two new subject papers were introduced – ES (Environmental Science and Engineering) and XH (Humanities and Social Sciences) in Economics/English/Linguistics/Philosophy /Psychology/Sociology taking the total number of subject papers to 27. Also, for the first time, third-year students were eligible to appear for the exam in which around 10,000 qualified out of the close to 1 lakh applicants.Deepankar Choudhury, GATE 2021 organising chairperson and institute chair professor, IIT-Bombay, says, “The flexibility in norms which permits a greater number of aspirants to appear for the exam does not translate into more exam-ready and high-quality candidates. An increase in the total number of aspirants does not necessarily increase the percentage of qualifiers.”Third-year qualifiers are at an advantageChoudhury explains that those third-year students who qualified GATE 2021 can use their score next year on completion of their UG degrees since the validity of their score is for 3 years (in this case, till March 2024). It can either be a practice test enabling them to better their score next year or they can use this score as qualifying marks for gaining admission to HEIs. “Going by the percentage of qualifiers, around 10.6 % from the third year qualified the exam. If the third-year component is excluded, the percentage of non-third year candidates qualifying the exam has increased, in which case, the percentage of qualifiers in 2021 would have gone up to over 20%.”It may be noted that around 7,11,542 candidates had appeared for GATE 2021, out of which 1,26,813 candidates qualified for the exam. When compared to 2020, a total of 8,58,890 candidates registered for the GATE 2020 exam wherein 6,85088 candidates appeared for the exam out of which 18.8% candidates were declared qualified.Difficulty vs PerformanceHumanities candidates, says Choudhury, who were attempting the exam for the first time fared better than many other qualifiers with 23.35% qualifying from XH-C6 (Sociology) – the highest in the stream, followed by XH-C5 (Psychology) where the percentage of qualifying candidates was 21.38%; while XH-C3 (Linguistics) had relatively lesser qualifiers at 20%.“Number of qualifiers varies in each subject, with ST (Statistics) registering the lowest percentage of qualifiers at 8.42%. This signifies that it had the toughest paper among all the subjects, as compared to GG (Geophysics) which had the highest percentage of qualified candidates at 29.54%. ES (Environmental Science and Engineering) had a fairly good percentage of qualifying candidates at 20.82% due to a moderately difficult paper,” Choudhury says.Last year in GATE 2020, percentage of qualifiers in BM (Biomedical Engineering) paper was lowest, at 3.25%, followed by MA (Math) paper, at 5.26%. “The percentage of qualifiers in these two papers have gone up to 22.04% and 19% respectively showing a significant improvement in GATE 2021 where the lowest percentage of qualified candidates in ST (Statistics) paper is still higher than that of last year's MA (Math) and BM (Biomedical Engineering) papers,” Choudhury says.COVID impact on candidatesOverall, the pandemic has not majorly impacted the performance of candidates and even the attendance figures were similar as compared to previous years. \"COVID also provided a certain percentage of students the opportunity to engage in self-study sans any distractions, while there were others who had to face a lack of financial and digital resources that may have impacted their scores a few notches,” Choudhury adds.DownloadThe Times of India News App for LatestHome NewsSubscribeStart Your Daily Mornings with Times of India Newspaper!Order NowPost a commentBe the first one to review+^ Back to Top Characters Remaining: 3000 Continue without login or Login from existing account Facebook Google Email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Refrain from posting comments that are obscene, defamatory or inflammatory, and do not indulge in personal attacks, name calling or inciting hatred against any community.

          "Also, for the first time, third-year students were eligible to appear for the exam in which around 10,000 qualified out of the close to 1 lakh applicants.Deepankar Choudhury, GATE 2021 organising chairperson and institute chair professor, IIT-Bombay, says, “The flexibility in norms which permits a greater number of aspirants to appear for the exam does not translate into more exam-ready and high-quality candidates.",
          "If the third-year component is excluded, the percentage of non-third year candidates qualifying the exam has increased, in which case, the percentage of qualifiers in 2021 would have gone up to over 20%.”",
          "When compared to 2020, a total of 8,58,890 candidates registered for the GATE 2020 exam wherein 6,85088 candidates appeared for the exam out of which 18.8% candidates were declared qualified.Difficulty vs PerformanceHumanities candidates, says Choudhury, who were attempting the exam for the first time fared better than many other qualifiers with 23.35% qualifying from XH-C6 (Sociology) – the highest in the stream, followed by XH-C5 (Psychology) where the percentage of qualifying candidates was 21.38%; while XH-C3 (Linguistics) had relatively lesser qualifiers at 20%.",
          "ES (Environmental Science and Engineering) had a fairly good percentage of qualifying candidates at 20.82% due to a moderately difficult paper,” Choudhury says.Last year in GATE 2020, percentage of qualifiers in BM (Biomedical Engineering) paper was lowest, at 3.25%, followed by MA (Math) paper, at 5.26%.",
          "“The percentage of qualifiers in these two papers have gone up to 22.04% and 19% respectively showing a significant improvement in GATE 2021 where the lowest percentage of qualified candidates in ST (Statistics) paper is still higher than that of last year's MA (Math) and BM (Biomedical Engineering) papers,” Choudhury says.COVID impact on candidatesOverall, the pandemic has not majorly impacted the performance of candidates and even the attendance figures were similar as compared to previous years."

Health and Human Services are scrambling to make room for the children.Senator Ted Cruz has been very outspoken about the crisis at the border. In Dallas to take a look at the convention center which is housing migrant children, he pointed directly to President Biden.\"This is a humanitarian crisis, it's a national security crisis, and it is a public health crisis, and all of this was entirely preventable,\" Cruz said.Cruz bluntly stated that there are several reasons why we're seeing more migrants. One of those reasons involves the reversal of the remain in Mexico policy established under former President Donald Trump.\"Joe Biden ended the remain in Mexico international agreement. One of the most significant accomplishments of the Trump administration is President Trump had negotiated with the government to Mexico an agreement that individuals from Central America who are crossing illegally through Mexico would remain in Mexico while their asylum cases were proceeding here in the United States,\" Cruz said.Locally, information is still limited on the Midland facility. However, local leaders are finally starting to get a peek inside. Midland mayor Patrick Payton said that some city council members got a look inside and assured him that the kids are being cared for.\"He assured me they are keeping the COVID kids separate from those who are not. The kids are being dressed well, the kids are being fed well, the kids are being taken care of. I was also assured and again I’ll affirm this tomorrow night that the staff out there is doing the best they can do,\" Payton said.Payton also said that we may finally have an answer as to how the community can help these kids while they stay here.\"So we want to find out how our community can do the best they can with what they want to do to try to help take care of these kids. To quote one of our councilmembers, these kids in many respects hit the jackpot with where they are right now as far as the facility so we want to be able to help them as much as we can,\" Payton said.",

      "body": "In their recently published book, journalists Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes argue that their main takeaway from Joe Biden's win in 2020 is that he got lucky.\nIndeed, they choose that word as their title: \"Lucky: How Joe Biden Barely Won the Presidency.\"\nIs this really the right way to think about Biden's win? The concept of \"luck\" is actually surprisingly slippery — someone can be called both lucky and unlucky for the same event. If I get hit by a car while crossing the road but walk away uninjured, you might say I got lucky that it wasn't much worse. But I might fairly say that if I were really lucky, I wouldn't have gotten hit at all.\n\nAllen and Parnes' subtitle gives a clue at what they mean by \"lucky.\" They say Biden \"barely\" won the presidency, by which they mean he came very close to losing to Donald Trump in 2020. I made a very similar point, but to very different ends, in a piece arguing that American democracy is lurching from crisis to crisis with no clear path out.\nThroughout the narrative, Allen and Parnes suggest that at the crucial moments, certain factors had to go just right for Biden to win, and they did. For example, just ahead of the Iowa caucuses, Pete Buttigieg's campaign was able to get a poll spiked on thin grounds that would have shown Biden likely to finish miserably in the state (Buttigieg's performance in the poll was also below expectations.) That fortunate event prevented Biden from going into the caucuses after a news cycle about how he looked surprisingly weak. And then again on the caucus night itself, a technological failure meant the results of the full caucus couldn't be readily ascertained. Suddenly, the national story was about the caucus's technical disaster, not Biden's poor showing in the state. Another lucky break for Biden, according to Allen and Parnes.\nThey point to other trends being broadly fortunate for Biden as well. The pandemic, they say, exposed Trump's weaknesses and gave Biden an excuse to stay out of the spotlight. Hunkered down in his basement, his approval ratings were able to stay high while the country went to hell on Trump's watch. Initially, too, they suggest that the George Floyd protests put Trump in a negative light — another unpredictable event that went Biden's way.\nHowever, they later argue that the issue of police conduct put Biden in a bind (they don't address how this affects their thesis that he was \"lucky.\") Trump could hit Biden from both sides — attacking him on not doing enough to stand up for police and against rioters, while also dredging up his history with the 1990s crime bill to paint Biden as too harsh on crime.\nThe effects of the 2020 summer protests on the election remain hotly debated, and I won't get into most of that here. But I should note that there's not much reason to buy that Trump's attempt to come at Biden from both sides really made much sense. Biden presented himself with a clear, measured, coherent position — he wanted more funding for the police, not less, while enacting significant reforms to prevent abusive conduct from cops. He also repeatedly said he was against any violence in protests. Trump's positioning was much less coherent. He wanted to be the \"tough-on-crime\" president even while decrying the country as a crime-riddled mess and attacking his opponent as overly punitive of criminals.\nFinally, the authors argue that, given that Biden only won the election with a slim cumulative margin of about 50,000 votes in the key swing states, his final victory was his last lucky break.\nThe narrative overall may seem compelling at first glance. But under scrutiny, it's far less persuasive. While acknowledging, as I have, that the concept of luck is fuzzy, it's more reasonable to describe Biden's position in the 2020 campaign as resilient rather than lucky. Despite significant obstacles in his way, Biden's candidacy was just strong enough on its own merits to succeed.\nI don't mean to tell a heroic or hagiographic tale about Biden's victory. But the fact is that from the very start, looking at the 2020 primary polls, and the national head-to-head polls with Trump, Biden looked like the favorite nearly the entire time. You might say he was \"lucky,\" then, in the sense of coming in some sense from a place of advantage privilege. He started with high name recognition and trust because he was Barack Obama's well-liked vice president for eight years, and he was a known quantity in troubled times. But this isn't the sense of \"lucky\" that Allen and Parnes seem to mean.\nThey frequently describe Biden's campaign as shambolic and dysfunctional, suggesting that he's lucky he was able to win despite this poor operation. This perspective, though, seems to reflect the preoccupations of campaign reporters more than Biden's objective standing in the race. Whatever flaws we might say Biden's campaign might have had, they don't seem to have affected his ability to win very much, because he succeeded regardless. That's because he entered the race strong due to his standing with public, and his network of formidable allies, and he stayed that way until the end. That wasn't a fluke — that's just who Biden is.\nTake the case of the Iowa caucuses, which Allen and Parnes discuss at great length. They suggest Biden was lucky that other incidents distracted from his poor showing in the first contest of the primary. But another way to look at the situation is to say that Biden was unlucky to have the primary start in a state where his support was so minimal, given the fact that he had the largest base of support of all the candidates. That was a structural disadvantage for a campaign that on the merits looked to have most support among the Democratic Party voters — and appeared most likely to win in the general election. Biden was able to survive a poor showing in Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada not because he lucked out — but because his national standing was so robust that even with three embarrassing losses, he could still turn it around.\nAfter his initial losses, his polling dropped sharply, and it looked for a spell that Sanders was most likely to win. But it turned out his former voters didn't stray from, and they would soon be back. His apparent weakness at this time was more of a mirage than a veritable shift in the sentiment of the electorate.\nTwo of his closest opponents, Buttigeg and Amy Klobubchar, dropped out after Biden's definitive win in South Carolina, the primary that marked the start of his resurgence. But Klobuchar and Buttigieg did drop out because Biden got a lucky break — they dropped out because they realized they never had a chance to win. Biden always did, and they were convinced he was the right person to lead the party forward. Again, that's not a fluke — that's what happens when you're a strong candidate in an election.\nOnce the race came down to just Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden, Biden won handily. He blew Sanders out even in states where he didn't try to compete. And in his one-on-one debate with Sanders, he showed himself to be much more competent than he had appeared in the multi-candidate debates that had occurred early on in the primary, when he consistently struggled. Again, this suggests that Biden was unlucky to face such a large field to start, even though he was able to overcome this disadvantage.\nYou might argue, as Allen and Parnes did, that it was \"lucky\" in a narrow sense for Biden's campaign that the coronavirus started dominating the entire world of politics by the spring of 2020, directing the spotlight away from the Democratic nominee. But the truth is that Biden led Trump in the polls in the fall of 2019, often by more than he did in the summer of 2020, so it's hard to say Biden needed the crisis to outshine his opponent.\nAs we learned, of course, the polls were misleading. Biden's final lead over Trump in the national popular vote was 4.4 points, but the polls had suggested it could easily have been double that. That was, actually, another disadvantage for Biden: the polling gave his side false confidence and a misleading sense of the nature of the race, which makes it difficult to find the right strategy.\nNevertheless, Biden won. And he won despite the fact that the Electoral College was heavily biased in Trump's favor. But once again, it's a little odd to describe this as Biden being lucky — this is Biden winning despite a systematic disadvantage against him. Biden was politically strong enough to win even though circumstances weren't all falling his way.\nAllen and Parnes certainly don't try to claim that luck was the only factor in Biden's win — they admit he had to have genuine skill to end up occupying the Oval Office. But these are caveats to their central thesis and the title of their book. As a way of understanding the nature of the 2020 campaign, \"Lucky\" falls flat. The decision to frame an entire narrative around Biden's ascension as a series of flukes is fundamentally misguided. The American people might have gotten lucky not to end up with a second term of Trump — but Biden appears to have known what he was doing all along.\nFrom Your Site Articles\n\n        Related Articles Around the Web",

          "For example, just ahead of the Iowa caucuses, Pete Buttigieg's campaign was able to get a poll spiked on thin grounds that would have shown Biden likely to finish miserably in the state (Buttigieg's performance in the poll was also below expectations.)",
          "But the fact is that from the very start, looking at the 2020 primary polls, and the national head-to-head polls with Trump, Biden looked like the favorite nearly the entire time.",
          "They frequently describe Biden's campaign as shambolic and dysfunctional, suggesting that he's lucky he was able to win despite this poor operation.",
          "You might argue, as Allen and Parnes did, that it was \"lucky\" in a narrow sense for Biden's campaign that the coronavirus started dominating the entire world of politics by the spring of 2020, directing the spotlight away from the Democratic nominee."

      "body": "“The letter about the ‘Chinese man with exaggerated slanted eyes’ about not being ‘realistic’ and being part of ‘cancel culture’ is stupid. These books were written/drawn from a perspective of racist views to influence the ways people think about and treat others. Another writer called the corona virus: ‘China Virus’ like Trump, deliberately bringing division, hatred and violence on 3,800 Asian-Americans this year alone. Words matter. So no it’s not a ‘win-win’ because no one wins with hate. Trump is gone — thankfully — and the public’s blood pressure has gone down! The fools who believed him send money for cheap flags that rip in the wind, like the promises he made and broke. President Biden is the right man for the job. Trump is an unAmerican loser, a cheat and a criminal who tried to overturn the election and called for the for the Jan. 6 insurrection!”On high school sports:“What happened to the Delaware League? Kudos to Charlotte Valley and Downsville for making the decision to have sports for their students. At least two schools got it right. Shame on the rest of the schools and their leadership for their draconian decision not to have sports for their students. I would be willing to bet that the people making these decisions still go to the grocery store, still go out to eat and probably even travel. It’s time to stop hiding behind COVID-19 and using it as an easy excuse to cancel. Please start putting some thought and vision into moving forward.”On Unadilla House arrests:“Get them out! Thanks to these stupid laws put in place these people are arrested for stealing, causing daily disturbances and selling and doing drugs right across the street from OUR children’s park and then let out the same day. Given an appearance ticket. Are we waiting for something worse to happen? They have to go! Sick of reading these terrible articles. You would think something would be done, but no. The criminals have more rights than the law abiding citizens.”On Christmas decorations:“For the people who obviously do not know why they celebrate Christmas, as they still have their Christmas decorations on display: The 12 days of Christmas ended in January. We are now in the Lenten season, awaiting the crucifixion of Christ and Easter, the celebration of his rising from the dead on the third day following his death on the cross. It is painful to see displays celebrating his birth at this time. be considerate and remove the lights, wreaths, etc.”On Gov. Cuomo:“Do not have him step down, let the investigation continue. In the meantime, why not get the truth on him being at fault for 13,000 to 15,000 deaths from his coronavirus actions? It would seem more important to answer this large number of older Americans’ deaths first! He also signed bills to OK deaths by abortions. He may be guilty of sexual harassment, but being guilty of the deaths of thousands of New Yorkers is a more serious crime. New York has its own Grim Reaper.”Want to tell us what you really think?The Daily Star accepts anonymous comments for “Sound Off.”Send your comments to us at The Daily Star, Attn: Editor, 102 Chestnut St., Oneonta, NY 13820, or email letters@thedailystar.com.

It’s especially the assumption of service from the people who rely on the service jobs.”\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"One of the most jarring elements of the Diamond Princess story was that it was essentially a case study for how COVID operates and spreads, yet the U.S. government didn’t act on it.

      "body": "Dr. Frank Sauer studied political science, sociology, philosophy and international law at Goethe University Frankfurt, from where he also received his doctoral degree. He is the author of Atomic Anxiety: Deterrence, Taboo, and the Non-Use of U.S. Nuclear Weapons and the co-editor of the German language Handbook of International Relations. He works on international politics with a focus on security. He has done research on nuclear issues, terrorism, cyber security as well as emerging technologies, especially the military application of artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics. Frank is a leading member of the International Committee for Robot Arms Control. He also serves as a Senior Advisor on the International Panel on the Regulation of Autonomous Weapons as well as on the expert commission on the responsible use of technologies in the European ‘Future Combat Air System’.\n\nWhere do you see the most exciting research/debates happening in your field?\n\nI’ve spent the last ten years working in an interdisciplinary fashion. For my research on autonomy in weapons systems, I spoke to AI experts, roboticists, moral philosophers, legal scholars and activists at United Nations more so than I did to IR scholars. I also read a lot in those disciplines, harking back to “genuine” IR topics only when drawing on literature on international norms and arms control. My last article was published in the International Review of the Red Cross, not what you would call an IR journal. So, in short, I’m not a hundred percent sure what “my field” is at this point. But what I can say is that among the last things that piqued my interest in IR proper were Wendt’s book Quantum Mind and Social Science as well as some of the contributions to the so-called New Materialism, for example Jane Bennett’s book Vibrant Matter. But I don’t think these things – especially Wendt’s book – moved the needle the same way they maybe would have in the past. There don’t seem to be “great debates” (theoretically) advancing IR as a field as a whole anymore – if those ever really existed. Instead, IR strikes me as a very pluralistic, even, to some extent, compartmentalized endeavour nowadays. There’s two ways of looking at this: One could view this as increasing the danger of scholars talking past each other and of the brand essence of IR being lost. That’s the glass-half-empty view, I suppose. But IR always was a hodgepodge of disciplines anyway, and so the glass-half-full perspective is that more work in IR is focused on finding answers to real world problems – by pragmatically drawing on whatever is needed.\n\nHow has the way you understand the world changed over time, and what (or who) prompted the most significant shifts in your thinking?\n\nTough question. I don’t subscribe to a particular “school of thought” or “-ism”, and I don’t have a favourite thinker who provides me with clever quote to put at the beginning of every article I write. But a significant shift in my thinking was triggered by the understanding that not all sciences produce the same kind of knowledge. Take what the natural sciences have produced on a phenomenon like gravity as an example. We still don’t really know what gravity is at a deep, quantum level. And the knowledge produced by the natural sciences is always only temporarily valid, of course. All its claims are always the state-of-the-art only for as long as something better has not yet been discovered or proven by using the commonly agreed upon methods of knowledge production and quality control. We can witness a time lapse of this incremental process on a daily basis during the ongoing pandemic. But, to get back to my example, we’ve arrived at a firm enough grasp on gravity to make fantastic predictions and calculations possible. We know about acceleration, motion, frames of reference, and I know that I will plunge to my death if I jump out of my office window – a reproducible result, should someone be foolish enough to repeat that same experiment. We also knew that, absent any technical malfunctions, the newest Mars rover would touch down on Mars because the smart folks at NASA had calculated the trajectory.\n\nSo, while the truth claims of the natural science are necessarily limited (and we haven’t even gone into the politicisation of science or the complications that science-and-technology-studies have revealed to exist), they are markedly different from the knowledge the social sciences – or IR, for that matter –produce. Even though there is a strong research community in IR that models their approach after the natural sciences, the discipline has produced nothing that is even close to what physics has produced about gravity in terms of nomothetic value. For a while, we thought the “Democratic Peace” is IR’s first generalizable discovery comparable to a natural law. Well, not it’s not, really. The flip side of all of this is that we’re still having the same debate about, say, Realism vs. Idealism that, depending on who you ask, is a hundred or two thousand years old. In other words, while the natural sciences have a big and growing scrap heap of discarded theories, things that turned out to definitely being not true, such as the aether theories, we never completely disprove anything. But I guess that’s alright because the objects of investigation we are concerned with in IR fundamentally differ from the rocks, neutrons and black holes that physicists deal with. “God gave physics the easy problems”, Bernstein, Lebow, Gross Stein and Weber once said. They nailed it. To truly understand that was a major, quite humbling shift in my thinking.\n\nIn 2018, the US withdrew from the Iran Nuclear Deal (JCPOA). Later on, Iran announced its non-compliance with the agreement. How can Biden encourage Iran to comply with the original agreement?\n\nIran has taken numerous problematic but discrete and reversible steps over the last months and years, for instance regarding uranium enrichment. In addition, Iran recently escalated things considerably by announcing the suspension of the Additional Protocol. Thankfully, the IAEA and Iran reached an agreement so that some verification and monitoring can continue for now. Video monitoring data are exempt, however. And if sanctions are not lifted, Iran will delete these three months from now. This puts even more pressure on a situation that clearly was and remains to be quite worrisome. There is deep distrust on both sides, and US-Iranian relations will keep deteriorating as long as the deal is not put back together. Currently it looks like the two sides are waiting for the other one to make the first move. The Biden administration is offering to start new talks. But Biden’s secretary of state Tony Blinken also keeps emphasizing that from a US point of view there is a lot that needs to happen before an agreement can be reached. So, it’s unfortunately not as simple as the US just “re-entering”. It might well be the case that the Biden administration is aiming for a “better deal” for domestic reasons, eyeing additional Iranian concessions – missile capabilities come to mind. This could complicate things further, and Iran, obviously disgruntled after suffering from years of “maximum pressure” by the US and General Soleimani being killed in a US drone strike, might even walk away in the end. We will have to see what the other parties to the agreement can contribute. The Europeans did not do great with the Instex mechanism and their efforts to uphold the economic end of the deal for the Iranians in light of US sanctions. Their influence remains somewhat limited. But my hope is nevertheless that in three months – if things go really well – there are talks underway to take this deal back on track to before Trump broke it. Fingers crossed.\n\nDonald Trump claimed that the New START treaty between Russia and the United States favoured Russia and was not worth an extension. After a few days in the White House, Biden extended the agreement. What factors supported Biden’s decision to sign the agreement in its previous form rather than renegotiate it? Should he have tried to include other parties, such as China?\n\nDonald Trump was wrong. Joe Biden was right in extending New START right away. Only a couple of days were left before New START would have expired. There was no time to renegotiate, and without New START nuclear arms control between the US and Russia would have been thrown back decades. Biden also extended New START immediately after entering office. That sends a clear signal as to how important nuclear arms control is to his administration. That’s encouraging. Now, the Trump administration did have a point in calling for China to be included in talks on nuclear arms control. But they went at it completely the wrong way, with empty threats, and with PR stunts such as placing little Chinese flags on the negotiating table in Vienna. It all seemed not only undiplomatic but, frankly, amateurish. China will – as long as the arsenals of the US and Russia remain that much bigger – politely, and with the new great-power-confidence China now displays routinely, keep declining any form of participation in the US-Russian START format. At the same time the medium range ballistic missile arsenal of China is of great concern to both Russia and the US. So, if China is to be engaged in this field it could be a good idea to seek much wider talks on strategic stability. Recently emerging hi-tech capabilities – unmanned systems, for instance – are increasingly entangling the conventional and the nuclear domain, creating new instabilities and escalation risks. So rather than trying to force China, which barely has any experience in arms control anyway, into START, a more promising first step could be a trilateral format on strategic stability in a wider sense, also including cyber, space and emerging technologies. These things worry Russia, the US and China alike – and so they could serve as a shared point of entry.\n\nIn your book you talk about deterrence and what you call the “nuclear taboo” as two explanations for the non-use of nuclear weapons. What is the nuclear taboo and why is this distinction from deterrence important?\n\nThe nuclear taboo is a strong social norm rendering a first use of nuclear weapons wrong – something that is just not done, maybe not even seriously considered. It’s a widespread normative understanding that ensures no civilized nation ever again creates destruction and suffering as witnessed in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Mainstream deterrence theory is based on a rational actor model: homo economicus. The nuclear taboo, in contrast, is based on a social constructivist notion of homo sociologicus acting according to a logic of appropriateness rather than a logic of consequentialism. That’s a fundamental difference. And this distinction is important because looking at the non-use of nuclear weapons after 1945 with the help of the nuclear taboo provides new answers and insights that deterrence fails to deliver. Take, for instance, this crucial question: If the essence of deterrence is that nuclear weapons have never been used between two or more nuclear powers, then why weren’t nuclear weapons ever used in conflicts in which only one state had them and there was no threat of retaliation – such as the Korean War, the Vietnam War or the 1990/91 Gulf War? So, I can only encourage everyone in IR to especially engage with Nina Tannenwald’s original work on this – it’s totally brilliant. And there remains a lot to study and learn about the nuclear taboo. My own contribution – in Atomic Anxiety, my 2015 book you mentioned – was to seek the emotional underpinnings of the nuclear taboo but also of deterrence and of the phenomenon of nuclear non-use as a whole. Quite recently, survey studies have begun casting doubt on how robust the nuclear taboo really is regarding the US’s general population – these findings are quite disturbing and warrant further research. And lastly, there’s always the question of how universal the nuclear taboo really can be since it requires a couple of mechanisms that democracies are much more likely to develop than autocratic states. All in all, it’s a very interesting and important concept.\n\nIn January 2021, the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) went into effect. Given no country that publicly admits to possessing nuclear weapons voted in favour of the agreement, what are the practical consequences of the TPNW?\n\nThere won’t be big, immediate practical consequences of the TPNW. But the treaty is in force now, the norm is now clearly stipulated, codified and “out there”. One could say that the TPNW is making the nuclear taboo tangible. So, all members of the international community, including the nuclear weapons states, will sooner or later feel a need to adjust to that. There’s a small risk that the TPNW could fracture the international non-proliferation landscape, creating an exit for non-nuclear weapons states who are fed up with the standstill in the NPT’s non-proliferation regime. I don’t consider this a big risk. The TPNW is designed to prevent that. Then there are some people who complain that the norm is only having an effect in democratic states in which civil society is part of the discourse and affecting policy decisions on nuclear weapons. To that I say: It is what it is. Democracy is great, is it not? In Germany, we can already see the first gentle shifts in the debate, for instance regarding nuclear sharing. The next government will not as easily be able to simply “abstain” from the TPNW process and not relate to it whatsoever even if they, which they might, consider it not on top of the list of their preferred instruments to reach the goal of a world free of nuclear weapons which every German government tends to stipulate. In short, the treaty will have an effect. But it’s a slow burn, and the results are unclear. In fifty years from now, the treaty might have considerably changed our view on the role of nuclear weapons in international politics and diminished their acceptance as tools of state power, stigmatizing them even further. Don’t get me wrong: I don’t know for sure that this will be the outcome – no one knows. I’m not even particularly optimistic about it. But the TPNW clearly has that potential.\n\nOn your German podcast “Sicherheitshalber” you talked about the consequences of a NATO member joining the TPNW in the future. What implications would that have for NATO’s concept of nuclear sharing? Do you think nuclear sharing still has a future?\n\nThat’s a lot of questions rolled up in one. First things first: I think we are a long way away from any NATO member joining the TPNW anytime soon. NATO folks will claim that this is a mutually exclusive affair because NATO is a “nuclear alliance” (which it wasn’t for the longest time, but alright, here we are since 2010). The “International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons” will counter-argue that joining the TPNW is not a problem at all for NATO members. Be that as it may, I think it is in fact time for a critical look at nuclear sharing for a number of reasons. One, nuclear sharing is – and always has been – a bit dicey with regard to the NPT. You have to do a lot of legal jiu jitsu for it to pass the NPT test. Two, in geopolitical terms it is an “extra sausage”, as we say in German, that we in the West have allowed ourselves for decades – and there might come the time when we’re being called out for that. We certainly would not be enthusiastic if China were to start “sharing” nuclear capabilities with, I don’t know, North Korea. Three, and most importantly, the B-61 gravity bombs in Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Turkey serve little to no military purpose – NATO plans for using them, obviously, but in reality there is no credible mission for them due to operational and political constraints. In that sense, nuclear sharing truly is a relic of the Cold War. And while I’m not sure about Turkey and Italy, the general population in Germany, Belgium and Netherlands clearly wants to get rid of the bombs anyway. But here’s the rub: Those bombs remain an important political symbol for the alliance in terms of burden – or rather: threat – sharing as well as reassurance to the eastern NATO members. Hence, it’s not quite as simple as it may seem at first glance.\n\nWe recently had a debate about nuclear sharing in Germany because Mr. Rolf Mützenich of the Social Democrats, one of the two parties currently forming the government, suggested using the window of opportunity which is currently open with the nearing end of service of the Tornado aircraft. Rather than committing for another couple of decades to nuclear sharing by procuring a new nuclear capable carrier system, his argument went, we should rather rip off the band-aid and get out of the arrangement now, sending the B-61s in Büchel home to the US. But within NATO, this would create considerable collateral damage and cost Germany a lot of political capital. Hence my idea would be to seek the end of nuclear sharing in a future nuclear disarmament framework with Russia instead. An agreement in which nuclear sharing, in exchange for Russian concessions, is among the items the West puts on the negotiation table. This would produce actual, tangible benefits in arms control terms rather than just Karma points with the Western nuclear disarmament community. It’s recently become known that the US has been silently drawing down the numbers. Maybe the US’s appetite to uphold nuclear sharing is dwindling as well? In sum, my hope is that the Biden administration can initiate a process with Russia that charts a path towards the end of nuclear sharing.\n\nWhat is the most important advice you could give to young scholars of International Relations?\n\nIR is a fantastic field of study. But it is not a fantastic field to seek a career in. The academic job market is not only tough but, frankly, perverse in many respects. Until this changes at a fundamental level, people aiming for an academic career in IR need to be fully aware of the pitfalls, especially if they’re planning to one day also have a family. So, the advice I, unfortunately, feel compelled to give is to always keep other options open. IR can set you up perfectly for a great many jobs outside of academia. The trick is to know when to take that step.",

          "So, while the truth claims of the natural science are necessarily limited (and we haven’t even gone into the politicisation of science or the complications that science-and-technology-studies have revealed to exist), they are markedly different from the knowledge the social sciences – or IR, for that matter –produce.",
          "Even though there is a strong research community in IR that models their approach after the natural sciences, the discipline has produced nothing that is even close to what physics has produced about gravity in terms of nomothetic value.",
